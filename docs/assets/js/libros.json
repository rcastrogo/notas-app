The reader will learn the basics (or in some cases more) of various technologies along the way, but the focus is on building a foundation for software development.",

    "author": "Svein Linge & Hans Petter Langtangen",
    "content": "Computing, in the sense of doing mathematical calculations, is a skill that mankind has developed over thousands of years. Programming, on the other hand, is in its infancy, with a history that spans a few decades only. Both topics are vastly comprehensive and usually taught as separate subjects in educational institutions around the world, especially at the undergraduate level. This book is about the combination of the two, because computing today becomes so much more powerful when combined with programming.\r\n\r\nMost universities and colleges implicitly require students to specialize in computer science if they want to learn the craft of programming, since other student programs usually do not offer programming to an extent demanded for really mastering this craft. Common arguments claim that it is sufficient with a brief introduction, that there is not enough room for learning programming in addition to all other must-have subjects, and that there is so much software available that few really need to program themselves. A consequence is that engineering students often graduate with shallow knowledge about programming, unless they happened to choose the computer science direction.\r\n\r\nWe think this is an unfortunate situation. There is no doubt that practicing engineers and scientists need to know their pen and paper mathematics. They must also be able to run off-the-shelf software for important standard tasks and will certainly do that a lot. Nevertheless, the benefits of mastering programming are many.",

But they are quite a bit more complex than screwdrivers, and making them do the precise thing you want them to do isn&rsquo;t always easy.\r\n\r\nIf the task you have for your computer is a common, well-understood one, such as showing you your email or acting like a calculator, you can open the appropriate application and get to work. But for unique or open ended tasks, there may not be an application.\r\n\r\nThat is where programming may come in. Programming is the act of constructing a program&mdash;a set of precise instructions, that tell a computer what to do. Because computers are dumb, pedantic beasts, programming is fundamentally tedious and frustrating. \r\n\r\nFortunately, if you can get over that, and maybe even enjoy the rigor of thinking in terms that dumb machines can deal with, programming can be very rewarding. It allows you to do things that would take forever by hand in seconds. It is a way to make your computer tool do things that it couldn&rsquo;t do before. And it provides a wonderful exercise in abstract thinking.\r\n\r\nMost programming is done with programming languages. A programming language is an artifcially constructed language used to instruct computers. It is interesting that the most eﬀective way we&rsquo;ve found to communicate with a computer borrows so heavily from the way we communicate with each other. Like human languages, computer languages allow words and phrases to be combined in new ways, allowing you to express ever new concepts.",

    "author": "Mikhail Prokopenko",
    "content": "Complex systems is a new approach to science, engineering, health and management that studies how relationships between parts give rise to the collective emergent behaviours of the entire system, and how the system interacts with its environment. \r\n\r\nWhat makes a system &lsquo;complex&rsquo;? A system can be thought of as complex if its dynamics cannot be easily predicted, or explained, as a linear summation of the individual dynamics of its components. In other words, the many constituent microscopic parts bring about macroscopic phenomena that cannot be understood by considering a single part alone (&lsquo;the whole is more than the sum of the parts&rsquo;). There is a growing awareness that complexity is strongly related to criticality: the behaviour of dynamical spatiotemporal systems at an order/disorder phase transition where scale invariance prevails. \r\n\r\nComplex systems can also be viewed as distributed information-processing systems, particularly in the domains of computational neuroscience, health, bioinformatics, systems biology and artificial life. Consciousness emerging from neuronal activity and interactions, cell behaviour resultant from gene regulatory networks and swarming behaviour are all examples of global system behaviour emerging as a result of the local interactions of the individuals (neurons, genes, animals). Can these interactions be seen as a generic computational process? This question shapes the third component of our symposium, linking computation to complexity and criticality.\r\n\r\nWe will consider a diverse range of systems, applications, theoretical and practical approaches to computational modelling of modern complex systems, including information theory, agent-based simulation, network theory, nonlinear dynamics, swarm intelligence, evolutionary methods, computational neuroscience, and econophysics, among others.",

    "author": "Bernt Arne Ødegaard",
    "content": "This book is a a discussion of the calculation of specific formulas in finance. The field of finance has seen a rapid development in recent years, with increasing mathematical sophistication. While the formalization of the field can be traced back to the work of Markowitz (1952) on investors mean-variance decisions and Modigliani and Miller (1958) on the capital structure problem, it was the solution for the price of a call option by Black and Scholes (1973); Merton (1973) which really was the starting point for the mathematicalization of finance. The fields of derivatives and fixed income have since then been the main fields where complicated formulas are used. This book is intended to be of use for people who want to both understand and use these formulas, which explains why most of the algorithms presented later are derivatives prices.\r\n\r\nThis project started when I was teaching a course in derivatives at the University of British Columbia, in the course of which I sat down and wrote code for calculating the formulas I was teaching. I have always found that implementation helps understanding these things. For teaching such complicated material it is often useful to actually look at the implementation of how the calculation is done in practice. The purpose of the book is therefore primarily pedagogical, although I believe all the routines presented are correct and reasonably efficient, and I know they are also used by people to price real options. \r\n\r\nTo implement the algorithms in a computer language I choose C++. My students keep asking why anybody would want to use such a backwoods computer language, they think a spreadsheet can solve all the worlds problems. I have some experience with alternative systems for computing, and no matter what, in the end you end up being frustrated with higher end &ldquo;languages&rdquo;, such as Matlab og R (Not to mention the straitjacket which is is a spreadsheet.) and going back to implementation in a standard language. In my experience with empirical finance I have come to realize that nothing beats knowledge a real computer language. This used to be FORTRAN, then C, and now it is C++. All example algorithms are therefore coded in C++. I do acknowledge that matrix tools like Matlab are very good for rapid prototyping and compact calculations, and will in addition to C++ in places also illustrate the use of Matlab, as well as other (public domain) tools.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This book has been released by its author.",

    "author": "Laurent Rosenfeld & Allen B. Downey",
    "content": "Welcome to the art of computer programming and to the new Perl 6 language. This will probably be the first published books using Perl 6 (or one of the first), a powerful, expressive, malleable and highly extensible programming language. But this book is less about Perl 6, and more about learning how to write programs for computers.\r\n\r\nThis book is intended for beginners and does not require any prior programming knowledge, but it is my hope that even those of you with programming experience will benefit from reading it.\r\n\r\nThis aim of this book is not primarily to teach Perl 6, but instead to teach the art of programming, using the Perl 6 language. After having completed this book, you should hopefully be able to write programs to solve relatively difficult problems in Perl 6, but my main aim is to teach computer science, software programming, and problem solving rather than solely to teach the Perl 6 language itself.\r\n\r\nThis means that I will not cover every aspect of Perl 6, but only a (relatively large, but yet incomplete) subset of it. By no means is this book intended to be a reference on the language.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to learn programming or to learn a new programming language by just reading a book; practicing is essential. This book contains a lot of exercises. You are strongly encouraged to make a real effort to do them. And, whether successful or not in solving the exercises, you should take a look at the solutions in the Appendix, as, very often, several solutions are suggested with further discussion on the subject and the issues involved. Sometimes, the solution section of the Appendix also introduces examples of topics that will be covered in the next chapter&ndash;and sometimes even things that are not covered elsewhere in the book. So, to get the most out the book, I suggest you try to solve the exercises as well as review the solutions and attempt them.",

    "content": "Originally term hacker meant someone who did the impossible with very little resources and much skill. The basic definition is &ldquo;someone who makes fine furniture with an axe&rdquo;. Hackers were the people who knew the computer inside and out and who could perform cool, clever, and impossible feats with their computers. Now days the term has been corrupted to mean someone who breaks into computers, but in this book we use hacker in its original honorable form.\r\n\r\nMy first introduction to true hackers was when I joined the Midnight Computer Club when I went to college. This wasn't an official club, just a group of people who hung out in the PDP-8 lab after midnight to program and discuss computers.\r\n\r\nI remember one fellow who had taken $10 of parts from Radio Shack and created a little black box which he could use with an oscilloscope to align DECTape drives. DEC at the time needed a $35,000 custom built machine to do the same thing. There were also some people there who enjoyed programming the PDP-8 to play music. This was kind of hard to do since the machine didn't have a sound card. But someone discovered that if you put a radio near the machine the interference could be heard on the speaker. After playing around with the system for a while people discovered how to generate tones using the\r\ninterference and thus MUSIC-8 programming system was born. So that the system didn't have a sound card didn't stop hackers from getting sound out of it. \r\n\r\nThis illustrates one of the attributes of great hacks, doing the &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; with totally inadequate resources.\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\nThis book contains a collection of hacks born out of over forty years of programming experience. Here you'll find all sorts of hacks to make your programs more reliable, more readable, and easier to debug. In the true hacker tradition, this is the result of observing what works and how it works, improving the system, and then passing the information on.",

I will try to be pragmatic.\r\n\r\nARM is a 32-bit architecture that has a simple goal in mind: flexibility. While this is great for integrators (as they have a lot of freedom when designing their hardware) it is not so good for system developers which have to cope with the differences in the ARM hardware. So in this text I will assume that everything is done on a Raspberry Pi Model B running Raspbian (the one with 2 USB ports and 512 MB of RAM).\r\n\r\nSome parts will be ARM-generic but others will be Raspberry Pi specific.

    "content": "Subject of this work is to give an introduction to the TinyOS Embedded Operating System. It explains the internal structure of the OS and points out its characteristics by comparing it to another embedded Operating System called MicroC/OS-II. By presenting several modules which have been written in the course of this project thesis the usage and practical applicability of TinyOS are shown. A setupguide for the used toolchain is provided in order to enable a quick and simple start into application developement.\r\n\r\nThis work is about the porting of TinyOS for the bigAVR6 platform for use in the Microcontroller Lab Course at the Vienna University of Technology. TinyOS is an open-source operating system, designed for use with wireless embedded sensor networks. There are 2 major stable branches, v.1.x and v2.x, which are not compatible to each other. TinyOS 2.x introduced some major improvements, for example the task scheduler was completely redesigned. In it&rsquo;s new version, the whole project is now distributed under the new BSD license too.\r\n\r\nBecause of TinyOS&rsquo;s component-based architecture, a high-level programmer does not have to rewrite all the used components from scratch, as long as the necessary modules are already exisiting. So, implementing new applications or changing exisiting ones is an easy and fast task. There are already existing implementations for a range of popular hardware motes, as for example the mica, iris and teleosa motes.",

    "title": "Category Theory for Programmers",
    "author": "Bartosz Milewski",
    "content": "For some time now I&rsquo;ve been floating the idea of writing a book about category theory that would be targeted at programmers. Mind you, not computer scientists but programmers &mdash; engineers rather than scientists. I know this sounds crazy and I am properly scared. I can&rsquo;t deny that there is a huge gap between science and engineering because I have worked on both sides of the divide. But I&rsquo;ve always felt a very strong compulsion to explain things. I have tremendous admiration for Richard Feynman who was the master of simple explanations. I know I&rsquo;m no Feynman, but I will try my best. I&rsquo;m starting by publishing this preface &mdash; which is supposed to motivate the reader to learn category theory &mdash; in hopes of starting a discussion and soliciting feedback.\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\nSince this is category theory for programmers I will illustrate all major concepts using computer code. You are probably aware that functional languages are closer to math than the more popular imperative languages. They also offer more abstracting power. So a natural temptation would be to say: You must learn Haskell before the bounty of category theory becomes available to you. But that would imply that category theory has no application outside of functional programming and that&rsquo;s simply not true. So I will provide a lot of C++ examples. Granted, you&rsquo;ll have to overcome some ugly syntax, the patterns might not stand out from the background of verbosity, and you might be forced to do some copy and paste in lieu of higher abstraction, but that&rsquo;s just the lot of a C++ programmer.\r\n\r\nBut you&rsquo;re not off the hook as far as Haskell is concerned. You don&rsquo;t have to become a Haskell programmer, but you need it as a language for sketching and documenting ideas to be implemented in C++. That&rsquo;s exactly how I got started with Haskell. I found its terse syntax and powerful type system a great help in understanding and implementing C++ templates, data structures, and algorithms. But since I can&rsquo;t expect the readers to already know Haskell, I will introduce it slowly and explain everything as I go.",

    "title": "Neural Networks: A Systematic Introduction",
    "author": "Raúl Rojas",
    "content": "This book arose from my lectures on neural networks at the Free University of Berlin and later at the University of Halle. I started writing a new text out of dissatisfaction with the literature available at the time. Most books on neural networks seemed to be chaotic collections of models and there was no clear unifying theoretical thread connecting them. The results of my efforts were published in German by Springer-Verlag under the title Theorie der neuronalen Netze. I tried in that book to put the accent on a systematic development of neural network theory and to stimulate the intuition of the reader by making use of many figures. Intuitive understanding fosters a more immediate grasp of the objects one studies, which stresses the concrete meaning of their relations. Since then some new books have appeared, which are more systematic and comprehensive than those previously available, but I think that there is still much room for improvement. The German edition has been quite successful and at the time of this writing it has gone through five printings in the space of three years. \r\n\r\nHowever, this book is not a translation. I rewrote the text, added new sections, and deleted some others. The chapter on fast learning algorithms is completely new and some others have been adapted to deal with interesting additional topics. The book has been written for undergraduates, and the only mathematical tools needed are those which are learned during the first two years at university. The book offers enough material for a semester, although I do not normally go through all chapters. It is possible to omit some of them so as to spend more time on others. Some chapters from this book have been used successfully for university courses in Germany, Austria, and the United States.\r\n\r\nThis book has been released as Open Access by its author.",

    "title": "Parsing Techniques. A Practical Guide",
    "author": "Dick Grune & Ceriel J. H. Jacobs",
    "content": "Parsing (syntactic analysis) is one of the best understood branches of computer science. Parsers are already being used extensively in a number of disciplines: in computer science (for compiler construction, database interfaces, self-describing data-bases, artificial intelligence), in linguistics (for text analysis, corpora analysis, machine translation, textual analysis of biblical texts), in document preparation and conversion, in typesetting chemical formulae and in chromosome recognition, to name a few; they can be used (and perhaps are) in a far larger number of disciplines. It is therefore surprising that there is no book which collects the knowledge about parsing and explains it to the non-specialist. Part of the reason may be that parsing has a name for being &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;. In discussing the Amsterdam Compiler Kit and in teaching compiler construction, it has, however, been our experience that seemingly difficult parsing techniques can be explained in simple terms, given the right approach. The present book is the result of these considerations. \r\n\r\nThis book does not address a strictly uniform audience. On the contrary, while writing this book, we have consistently tried to imagine giving a course on the subject to a diffuse mixture of students and faculty members of assorted faculties, sophisticated laymen, the avid readers of the science supplement of the large newspapers, etc. Such a course was never given; a diverse audience like that would be too uncoordinated to convene at regular intervals, which is why we wrote this book, to be read, studied, perused or consulted wherever or whenever desired. \r\n\r\nAddressing such a varied audience has its own difficulties (and rewards). Although no explicit math was used, it could not be avoided that an amount of mathematical thinking should pervade this book. Technical terms pertaining to parsing have of course been explained in the book, but sometimes a term on the fringe of the subject has been used without definition. Any reader who has ever attended a lecture on a non-familiar subject knows the phenomenon. He skips the term, assumes it refers to something reasonable and hopes it will not recur too often. And then there will be passages where the reader will think we are elaborating the obvious (this paragraph may be one such place). The reader may find solace in the fact that he does not have to doodle his time away or stare out of the window until the lecturer progresses.",

    "content": "Los cursos de Arquitectura de Computadores se han visto obligados hist&oacute;ricamente a seguir el fren&eacute;tico ritmo marcado inicialmente por los avances tecnol&oacute;gicos y arquitect&oacute;nicos en el dise&ntilde;o de grandes computadores, y, posteriormente, a partir de los 80, por la evoluci&oacute;n en el dise&ntilde;o de microprocesadores. De hecho, se puede decir que la docencia en Arquitectura de Computadores ha pasado por seis grandes eras: mainframes, minicomputadores, primeros microprocesadores, microprocesadores, RISC y post RISC.\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\nEste libro es una versi&oacute;n ampliada y reestructurada del anterior. Incorpora aquellos aspectos te&oacute;ricos que no se abordaban en la versi&oacute;n previa, por lo que ahora debiera ser posible utilizarlo como material de referencia tanto de teor&iacute;a como de laboratorio. Adem&aacute;s, propone una secuenciaci&oacute;n distinta de algunos de sus cap&iacute;tulos, principalmente para que el primer contacto con el ensamblador sea con aquellos tipos de instrucciones conceptualmente m&aacute;s sencillos. Adicionalmente, los formatos de instrucci&oacute;n que antes se abordaban en un cap&iacute;tulo propio, ahora se han incluido en aquellos cap&iacute;tulos en los que se presentan las instrucciones correspondientes. Por &uacute;ltimo, se han reorganizado las colecciones de ejercicios en cada cap&iacute;tulo con el objetivo de que el estudiante explore todo el contenido de un cap&iacute;tulo antes de enfrentarse a ejercicios de mayor complejidad.\r\n\r\nEl libro est&aacute; estructurado en tres partes. La primera parte aborda los aspectos te&oacute;ricos b&aacute;sicos de la arquitectura de computadores. La segunda parte presenta aspectos m&aacute;s avanzados de los fundamentos de la arquitectura de computadores tomando como referencia la arquitectura ARM y proponiendo ejercicios sobre el simulador QtARMSim. La &uacute;ltima parte describe la problem&aacute;tica de la entrada/salida proponiendo una serie de pr&aacute;cticas con la tarjeta Arduino Due.",

    "content": "This volume deals with the prospect and &ldquo;evolution&rdquo; of Computer Science, which has become the operating system of our society. From individual to collectives, economics, politics, and society, Computer Science influences all spheres of our life. Its pervasive nature lays the foundations to an overarching technological environment carrying an inherent unprecedented potential for change. \r\n\r\nIn the following, we use the terms Computer Science and Informatics&mdash;not being totally correct&mdash;synonymously. As we use Kristen Nygaard&rsquo;s definition from the 1980s (there are many more, and quite differing ones): &ldquo;Informatics is the science that has as its domain information processes and related phenomena in artifacts, society and nature,&rdquo; Informatics (or Computer Science) is not anymore about a specific device, i.e., a computer, it is (or has become) a foundational discipline. \r\n\r\nToday, we see Computer Science as the science of the information society. Its artifacts change the world, and its methods have an impact on how we think about and how we perceive the world. In classical terms, we refer to an &ldquo;abstract&rdquo; machine which can be instantiated by software to any concrete problem-solving machine, having the unique feature to change its behavior due to external and internal states (being self-reflective and exhibiting &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; behavior). However, current phenomena such as the Web, cyber physical systems, or the Internet of Things (IoT) show us that we might already be beyond this idea, exemplifying a metamorphosis from a stand-alone calculator to the worldwide operating system of our society.",

The authors also address how to think about and assign value to the personal information assets being protected. Finally, the team of experts offers thoughts about the information revolution that has only just begun, and how we can live in a world of sensors and trillions of data points without losing our ethics or value(s)...and even have a little fun.\r\n\r\nThe Privacy Engineer's Manifesto is designed to serve multiple stakeholders: Anyone who is involved in designing, developing, deploying and reviewing products, processes, applications, and systems that process personal information, including software/hardware engineers, technical program and product managers, support and sales engineers, system integrators, IT professionals, lawyers, and information privacy and security professionals. This book is a must-read for all practitioners in the personal information economy.\r\n\r\nPrivacy will be an integral part of the next wave in the technology revolution; innovators who emphasize privacy as an integral part of the product life cycle are on the right track.",

    "title": "Signal Computing: Digital Signals in the Software Domain",
    "author": "Varios",
    "content": "As computers become ubiquitous, they become more and more embedded not only in the devices we own and use but in our lives. As a result, computers become embedded in the physical world, with their primary purpose being to detect and analyze happenings in our world and to produce responses that affect that world. As computing professionals, we need to understand how computers can process information from the physical world as digital signals: multimedia (sound, images, video) and other measurements (in medical instruments, cars, cell phones, eyeglasses, etc). This is why we have chosen to coin the phrase \\Signal Computing&quot;. \r\n\r\nDigital signals place great demands on processing power, network bandwidth, storage capacity, I/O speed, and software design. As a result, signal computing is a great laboratory for exercising the full range of knowledge of computer science. In this book, you will learn how digital signals are captured, represented, processed, communicated, and stored in computers. The specific topics we will cover include: physical properties of the source information (such as sound or images), devices for information capture (microphones, cameras), digitization, compression, digital signal representation (JPEG, MPEG), digital signal processing (DSP), and network communication. By the end of this book, you should understand the problems and solutions facing signal computing systems development in the areas of user interfaces, information retrieval, data structures and algorithms, and communications. \r\n\r\nWhile there certainly may be many opportunities for you to work in signal computing, the value of this study extends far beyond. Studying signal computing and its underlying mathematics directly exercises key computer science abilities in areas like abstraction and algorithmics. You will see that this book interleaves mathematical topics with applications and algorithms.",

Te book encompasses the installation issues, hardware optimization issues, software requirements, programming tasks, and performance optimizations that emerge when you consider programming for x86-based Android devices. Having worked on related projects ourselves, we committed to collecting our experience and information into one book which could be used as a guide through any project&rsquo;s specific requirements. We dove into fine-tuned optimizations, native code adjustments, hardware acceleration, and advanced profiling of multimedia applications. \r\n\r\nThe book is not dedicated solely to code, although you&rsquo;ll find plenty of code samples and case studies inside. Instead, we&rsquo;ve filled Android on x86 with the information you need in order to take advantage of the x86 architectures. We will guide you through installing the Android Software Development Kit for Intel Architectures, help you understand the diﬀerences and similarities between the processors available for commercial Android devices, teach you to create and port applications, debug existing x86 applications, oﬀer solutions for NDK and C++ optimizations, and introduce the Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager. Te information we&rsquo;ve pulled together provides the most useful help for getting your development job done quickly and well.",

For example, ML systems can be trained on automatic speech recognition systems (such as iPhone&rsquo;s Siri) to convert acoustic information in a sequence of speech data into semantic structure expressed in the form of a string of words. \r\n\r\nML is already finding widespread uses in web search, ad placement, credit scoring, stock market prediction, gene sequence analysis, behavior analysis, smart coupons, drug development, weather forecasting, big data analytics, and many more applications. ML will play a decisive role in the development of a host of user-centric innovations. \r\n\r\nML owes its burgeoning adoption to its ability to characterize underlying relationships within large arrays of data in ways that solve problems in big data analytics, behavioral pattern recognition, and information evolution. ML systems can moreover be trained to categorize the changing conditions of a process so as to model variations in operating behavior. As bodies of knowledge evolve under the influence of new ideas and technologies, ML systems can identify disruptions to the existing models and redesign and retrain themselves to adapt to and coevolve with the new knowledge.",

When you write a program, you should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to build and install the program.\r\n\r\nCapabilities of Make:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Make enables the end user to build and install your package without knowing the details of how that is done -- because these details are recorded in the makefile that you supply.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;Make figures out automatically which files it needs to update, based on which source files have changed. It also automatically determines the proper order for updating files, in case one non-source file depends on another non-source file. As a result, if you change a few source files and then run Make, it does not need to recompile all of your program. It updates only those non-source files that depend directly or indirectly on the source files that you changed.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;Make is not limited to any particular language. For each non-source file in the program, the makefile specifies the shell commands to compute it. These shell commands can run a compiler to produce an object file, the linker to produce an executable, ar to update a library, or TeX or Makeinfo to format documentation.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;li&gt;Make is not limited to building a package. You can also use Make to control installing or deinstalling a package, generate tags tables for it, or anything else you want to do often enough to make it worth while writing down how to do it.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;",

There are many biographical books about key individuals such as Bill Gates of Microsoft or John Sculley of Apple. Other books are also available providing details of certain companies and their products. These books quite naturally focus primarily on products associated with that particular individual or company. \r\n\r\nThe intent of this book is to provide a consolidated coverage of the significant developments in the evolution of the personal computer and related products. The book has some emphasis on the technical and commercial aspects of the developments as compared to the social details of the participants.\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\nThere are limitations on the amount and diversity of historical information that can be included in a book of this size. The amount of detail on a particular subject has therefore been limited to items of historical and commercial significance. As regards hardware, this has intentionally resulted in more detail on the significant early developments from Apple and IBM. In software there is greater coverage of details on the Microsoft Corporation and its significant products. Also the focus has been on North America, where most of the development in microprocessor and microcomputer technology has occurred. The references cited in the bibliography will extend each subject area as required. \r\n\r\nA few comments on qualification of dates and dollar figures for prices are appropriate. Dates are sometimes termed announced, introduced, launched, released and shipped. The dollar figures will vary depending on the manufacturer's list price, the price in advertising, the street price and the date of publication. There also tends to be some inconsistency in both dates and prices depending on the source. These variations in dates and prices tend to create some ambiguity. It is hoped that the reader will understand this and take the dates and prices in a relative sense within a historical context.",

If your domain is called data analysis, analytics, informatics, data science, reporting, business intelligence, data management, big data, or visualization, you just have to learn R as this programming language is a game-changing sledgehammer. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you have looked at a standard text on R or read some of the online discussions, you might feel that there is a steep learning curve of six months or more to grok the language. I will debunk this myth through my book by focusing on practical essentials instead of theory. \r\n\r\nIf you have programmed in some language in the past (whether that language be SAS, SPSS, C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Perl, Visual Basic, Ruby, Scala, shell scripts, or plain old SQL), even if you are rusty, this book will get you up and running with R in a single day, writing programs for data analysis and visualization. \r\n\r\nAt the end of this book you will be able to: \r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;write R programs to execute on the 3 major data-analysis phases. &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;visualize data in an illustrative and interactive manner &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;move on to using R for big data analytics &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nR you excited?

    "title": "Practical Guide to Bare Metal C++",
    "author": "Alex Robenko",
    "content": "The primary intended audience of this document is professional C++ developers who want to understand bare metal development a little bit better, get to know how to use their favourite programming language in an embedded environment, and probably bring their C++ skills to an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; level. Why professional? Because bare metal platform has lots of limitations. In most cases no exceptions and no runtime type information (RTTI) support will be available. In many cases the dynamic memory allocation will also be excluded. In order to be able to use C++ effectively you will have to have deep knowledge of existing C++ idioms, constructs and STL contents. You must know how your favourite data structures are implemented and whether it is possible to reuse them in your environment. If it is not possible to use the STL (or any other library) code &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, you will have to implement a reduced version of it, and it is better to know how the library developers implemented the feature and how to make it work with the constrains of your environment. \r\n\r\nThe professional embedded developers with intermediate knowledge of C++ may also find this document useful. They will probably benefit from lots of C++ insights and will have several &ldquo;eureka&rdquo; moments with &ldquo;I didn't know I could do that!!!&rdquo; kind of thoughts. \r\n\r\nIf your C++ knowledge doesn't go much beyond polymorphism and virtual functions, if template meta-programming doesn't mean anything to you, probably you are not ready to use C++ in the embedded environment and this document will probably be too complex to understand. I'd like to emphasise the fact that this is NOT a C++ tutorial. There are lots of resources on the web that teach conventional C++ with OS services, exceptions and RTTI. My personal opinion is that you have to master C++ in regular environment before using it effectively in the bare metal world.",

    "content": "Computers, such as microprocessors, are more and more often embedded in products that the user does not perceive as computers. This is the case for both consumer electronics (your CD player, mobile phone, etc.), home supplies (your micro-wave oven, washing machine, etc.), vehicles (the engine control in your car, airplane fly-by-wire control, etc.), building automation (elevator control, temperature control, etc.), as well as for industrial equipment. We want these things to be affordable, and we want to be able to trust their operation, in particular when our life depends on them. Additionally, in some cases, we want to be able to reconfigure, upgrade, or even program them, possibly by downloading software components from a trusted supplier via the Internet. \r\n\r\nMost people think of a computer as the desktop type of computer (with keyboard and display), but the number of embedded computers is bigger than the number of all other types of computers, and the difference is increasing. Moreover, the variety of types of processors and operating systems is much larger in the embedded world, which includes the desktop types and many others. Reasons for this variety include optimization to reduce the product price and minimization of energy (from batteries) consumption.\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\nWe will approach the real-time issues via established web-programming and concurrency techniques, which will reveal a few deficiencies of the standard Java platform. A real-time package (class library) and a few run-time extensions will be presented. The usage of these additions to create high performance real-time control software is then described in a real-time programming chapter which is central the topic of this book. The reader should then gain additional understanding and programming skill by studying the remaining chapters about scheduling, processes, and applications.",

    "title": "Introduction to Probability and Statistics Using R",
    "author": "G. Jay Kerns",
    "content": "This book was expanded from lecture materials I use in a one semester upper-division undergraduate course entitled Probability and Statistics at Youngstown State University. Those lecture materials, in turn, were based on notes that I transcribed as a graduate student at Bowling Green State University. The course for which the materials were written is 50-50 Probability and Statistics, and the attendees include mathematics, engineering, and computer science majors (among others). The catalog prerequisites for the course are a full year of calculus. \r\n\r\nThe book can be subdivided into three basic parts. The first part includes the introductions and elementary descriptive statistics; I want the students to be knee-deep in data right out of the gate. The second part is the study of probability, which begins at the basics of sets and the equally likely model, journeys past discrete/continuous random variables, and continues through to multivariate distributions. The chapter on sampling distributions paves the way to the third part, which is inferential statistics. This last part includes point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and finishes with introductions to selected topics in applied statistics. \r\n\r\nI usually only have time in one semester to cover a small subset of this book. I cover the material in Chapter 2 in a class period that is supplemented by a take-home assignment for the students. I spend a lot of time on Data Description, Probability, Discrete, and Continuous Distributions. I mention selected facts from Multivariate Distributions in passing, and discuss the meaty parts of Sampling Distributions before moving right along to Estimation (which is another chapter I dwell on considerably). Hypothesis Testing goes faster after all of the previous work, and by that time the end of the semester is in sight. I normally choose one or two final chapters (sometimes three) from the remaining to survey, and regret at the end that I did not have the chance to cover more. \r\n\r\nIn an attempt to be correct I have included material in this book which I would normally not mention during the course of a standard lecture. For instance, I normally do not highlight the intricacies of measure theory or integrability conditions when speaking to the class. Moreover, I often stray from the matrix approach to multiple linear regression because many of my students have not yet been formally trained in linear algebra. That being said, it is important to me for the students to hold something in their hands which acknowledges the world of mathematics and statistics beyond the classroom, and which may be useful to them for many semesters to come. It also mirrors my own experience as a student. \r\n\r\nThe vision for this document is a more or less self contained, essentially complete, correct, introductory textbook.",

    "content": "&Oslash;MQ (also known as ZeroMQ, &Oslash;MQ, or zmq) looks like an embeddable networking library but acts like a concurrency framework. It gives you sockets that carry atomic messages across various transports like in-process, inter-process, TCP, and multicast. You can connect sockets N-to-N with patterns like fan-out, pub-sub, task distribution, and request-reply. It&rsquo; s fast enough to be the fabric for clustered products. Its asynchronous I/O model gives you scalable multicore applications, built as asynchronous message-processing tasks. It has a score of language APIs and runs on most operating systems. &Oslash;MQ is from iMatix1 and is LGPLv3 open source. \r\n\r\n&lt;strong&gt;How It Began &lt;/strong&gt;\r\n\r\nWe took a normal TCP socket, injected it with a mix of radioactive isotopes stolen from a secret Soviet atomic research project, bombarded it with 1950-era cosmic rays, and put it into the hands of a drug-addled comic book author with a badly-disguised fetish for bulging muscles clad in spandex (see figure 1).

    "title": "Functional Programming in Python",
    "author": "David Mertz",
    "content": "We&rsquo;d better start with the hardest question: &ldquo;What is functional programming (FP), anyway?&rdquo; \r\n\r\nOne answer would be to say that functional programming is what you do when you program in languages like Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Scala, Haskell, ML, OCAML, Erlang, or a few others. That is a safe answer, but not one that clarifies very much. Unfortunately, it is hard to get a consistent opinion on just what functional programming is, even from functional programmers themselves. A story about elephants and blind men seems apropos here. It is also safe to contrast functional programming with &ldquo;imperative programming&rdquo; (what you do in languages like C, Pascal, C++, Java, Perl, Awk, TCL, and most others, at least for the most part). Functional programming is also not object-oriented programming (OOP), although some languages are both. And it is not Logic Programming (e.g., Prolog), but again some languages are multiparadigm.\r\n\r\nPython is most definitely not a &ldquo;pure functional programming language&rdquo;; side effects are widespread in most Python programs. That is, variables are frequently rebound, mutable data collections often change contents, and I/O is freely interleaved with computation. It is also not even a &ldquo;functional programming language&rdquo; more generally. However, Python is a multiparadigm language that makes functional programming easy to do when desired, and easy to mix with other programming styles.",

I believe TDD is a huge improvement over other software development methodologies I have used to deliver quality software. I believe this is true not only for me, but for many other software developers. Which makes me question, why don&rsquo;t more people learn and use TDD as their software delivery methodology of choice? In my professional life, I haven&rsquo;t seen the adoption rate to be big enough to justify the claim that TDD is currently in the mainstream. \r\n\r\nYou already have my respect for deciding to pick up a book, rather than building your understanding of TDD on the foundation of urban legends and your own imagination. I am honored and happy you chose this one, no matter if this is your first book on TDD or one of many you have opened up in your learning endeavors. As much as I really hope you will read this book from cover to cover, I am aware it doesn&rsquo;t always happen. That makes me want to ask you an important question that may help you determine whether you really want to read on: why do you want to learn TDD? \r\n\r\nBy questioning your motivation, I&rsquo;m not trying to discourage you from reading this book. Rather, I&rsquo;d like you to reconsider the goal you want to achieve by reading it. A few years ago, I had an apprentice who wanted to learn TDD. Together we started working on a small project to let him grasp the necessary skills through practice, with me sitting next to him, providing guidance. He showed up three or four times, then he resigned, having &ldquo;more urgent things to do&rdquo; and &ldquo;no time&rdquo;. Since then, he has not progressed in his understanding or utilization of TDD at all. Even today, I sometimes wonder what was his motivation and why it somehow burned out.",

    "content": "This is an introduction to real-time systems for engineering students who are not focused on computer or software engineering.\r\n\r\nThis course will being by introducing the requirements and constraints of real-time and embedded systems, together with examples. Next, we will consider various programming paradigms, appropriate characteristics for embedded and real-time programming languages, and an introduction to the C programming language and contrast it with C++. \r\n\r\nWe continue by describing the organization of a computer, including descriptions of Turing machines, register machines, main memory, processor architecture and operating systems. Continuing from here, we describe static memory allocation and the call stack, and then consider dynamic memory allocation, including numerous variable-sized-block strategies, their appropriateness for real-time systems and various implementations in FreeRTOS. We also consider automatic memory allocation, including garbage collection. \r\n\r\nFollowing this, we discuss the idea of threads and tasks running in parallel, looking at examples of sorting in parallel, and the data structures necessary to maintain threads. We then consider the issue of scheduling threads, first with multi-programming, non-preemptive scheduling and the concept of context switching, and then considering multitasking with preemptive scheduling, focusing on real-time schedulers such as earliest-deadline-first and ratemonotonic scheduling. Next, we consider the issue of the communication of other devices with the processor and the concept of interrupts and interrupt service routines as well as the impact of interrupts on real-time systems. \r\n\r\nNext we consider synchronization issues between cooperating threads and tasks, including issues of serialization and synchronization. We describe semaphores and consider a number of synchronization problems and consider solutions using semaphores. Additionally, we consider other means of automatic synchronization. With this, we consider the application of semaphores and synchronization in general to resource management, looking specifically at priority inversion. The most serious issue, however, is deadlock, when tasks and threads holding resources are mutually blocked on subsequent requests and how to avoid this issue. Next, inter-process communication is discussed together with how synchronization can be achieved through messaging. Next, we consider fault tolerance, specifically considering error detection and correction, the synchronization of clocks, and fault-tolerant message passing. Having considered all this, we now consider how resource management can be centralized in an operating system protected with fault tolerance through kernel modes and space. Having achieved this, we now consider the problem of software simulating including client-server models and distributions, and then software verification, including a look at propositional logic, predicate logic, linear temporal logic, computation tree logic and model checkers. \r\n\r\nWe conclude the course by consider issues of data management and file management, virtual memory and caching, digital signal processing and digital control theory, and finishing with an introduction to security and a look at what is ahead.",

Memories and disks were expensive, all applications were written to use byte strings using 8 bits encodings: one byte per character was a good compromise. \r\n\r\nToday with the Internet and the globalization, we all read and exchange documents from everywhere around the world (even if we don&rsquo;t understand everything). The problem is that documents rarely indicate their language (encoding), and displaying a document with the wrong encoding leads to a well known problem: mojibake. \r\n\r\nIt is difficult to get, or worse, guess the encoding of a document. Except for encodings of the UTF family (coming from the Unicode standard), there is no reliable algorithm for that. We have to rely on statistics to guess the most probable encoding, which is done by most Internet browsers. \r\n\r\nUnicode support by operating systems, programming languages and libraries varies a lot. In general, the support is basic or non-existent. Each operating system manages Unicode differently. For example, Windows stores filenames as Unicode, whereas UNIX and BSD operating systems use bytes. \r\n\r\nMixing documents stored as bytes is possible, even if they use different encodings, but leads to mojibake. Because libraries and programs do also ignore encode and decode warnings or errors, write a single character with a diacritic (any non-ASCII character) is sometimes enough to get an error. \r\n\r\nFull Unicode support is complex because the Unicode charset is bigger than any other charset. For example, ISO 8859-1 contains 256 code points including 191 characters, whereas Unicode version 6.0 contains 248,966 assigned code points. The Unicode standard is larger than just a charset: it explains also how to display characters (e.g. leftto-right for English and right-to-left for persian), how to normalize a character string (e.g. precomposed characters versus the decomposed form), etc. \r\n\r\nThis book explains how to sympathize with Unicode, and how you should modify your program to avoid most, or all, issues related to encodings and Unicode.",

    "content": "Most of the GNU Emacs text editor is written in the programming language called Emacs Lisp. You can write new code in Emacs Lisp and install it as an extension to the editor. However, Emacs Lisp is more than a mere &ldquo;extension language&rdquo;; it is a full computer programming language in its own right. You can use it as you would any other programming language. \r\n\r\nBecause Emacs Lisp is designed for use in an editor, it has special features for scanning and parsing text as well as features for handling fles, buﬀers, displays, subprocesses, and so on. Emacs Lisp is closely integrated with the editing facilities; thus, editing commands are functions that can also conveniently be called from Lisp programs, and parameters for customization are ordinary Lisp variables. \r\n\r\nThis manual attempts to be a full description of Emacs Lisp. For a beginner&rsquo;s introduction to Emacs Lisp, see An Introduction to Emacs Lisp Programming, by Bob Chassell, also published by the Free Software Foundation. This manual presumes considerable familiarity with the use of Emacs for editing; see The GNU Emacs Manual for this basic information. \r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the earlier chapters describe features of Emacs Lisp that have counterparts in many programming languages, and later chapters describe features that are peculiar to Emacs Lisp or relate specifcally to editing.",

R is designed primarily for use in statistics, but it is useful regardless of which scientific discipline you are pursuing. \r\n\r\nAs the data sets used in all scientific disciplines get ever larger it is becoming increasingly more critical for scientists to be knowledgeable about how to use high-level programming languages such as R, which allow for easy and intuitive use. I have titled this manual ―The Undergraduate Guide to R‖ because I want to emphasize that R is a skill that should be learned early in the modern student&lsquo;s career. Of course, however, I hope that this manual is useful to everyone who is just starting to use R, undergraduate or not. \r\n\r\nThis manual is designed so that no prior knowledge of programming is required or assumed (although rudimentary knowledge of general computer skills and statistics is a must). Thus, it may seem overly simple to many and I would highly recommend that those of you who find yourselves in this situation look at Section 12: Further Resources for more advanced manuals. \r\n\r\nThe main objectives of this manual are as follows: \r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Successfully install and run R on your computer &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Teach enough R that it is easy to do most common data manipulating, analyzing, comparing, and viewing tasks &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Provide knowledge foundation so that learning more advanced R techniques is possible &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Give general tips and suggestions about how to program in R 5.)

Si se quiere un estudio m&aacute;s purista sobre Scheme, revise el est&aacute;ndar R5RS que tambi&eacute;n es soportado por el int&eacute;rprete de Racket. \r\n\r\nLos temas abordados en la Parte I incluyen una introducci&oacute;n a la programaci&oacute;n funcional, una sencilla gu&iacute;a de instalaci&oacute;n de Racket y una introducci&oacute;n a la interacci&oacute;n con Racket y DrRacket. \r\n\r\nEn la Parte II se introduce el lenguaje Racket en s&iacute;, a trav&eacute;s de sus elementos b&aacute;sicos y los bloques lambda, caracter&iacute;sticos de la programaci&oacute;n funcional. \r\n\r\nLa Parte III describe los dem&aacute;s elementos del lenguaje y contiene m&uacute;ltiples ejercicios para que el lector practique sus nuevos conocimientos. \r\n\r\nFinalmente, la Parte IV muestra las capacidades de Racket para implementar programas con interfaces gr&aacute;ficas de usuario. \r\n\r\nY por &uacute;ltimo, la Parte V incluye un anexo describiendo las diferencias entre la versi&oacute;n 5 de Racket y la serie 4.x de PLT Scheme.",

    "title": "Introducción a la programación con Python",
    "author": "Andrés Becerra Sandoval",
    "content": "Como un educador, investigador y autor de libro, estoy encantado de ver la terminaci&oacute;n de este texto. Python es un lenguaje de programaci&oacute;n divertido y extremadamente f&aacute;cil de usar, que ha ganado renombre constantemente en los a&ntilde;os recientes. Desarrollado hace diez a&ntilde;os por Guido van Rossum, la sintaxis simple de Python y su &ldquo;sabor&rdquo; se derivan, en gran parte del ABC, un lenguaje de programaci&oacute;n para ense&ntilde;anza que se desarroll&oacute; en los 1980s. Sin embargo, Python tambi&eacute;n fue creado para resolver problemas reales y tiene una amplia gama de caracter&iacute;sticas que se encuentran en lenguajes de programaci&oacute;n como C++, Java, Modula-3, y Scheme. Debido a esto, uno de las caracter&iacute;sticas notables de Python es la atracci&oacute;n que ejerce sobre programadores profesionales, cient&iacute;ficos, investigadores, artistas y educadores. \r\n\r\nA pesar de &eacute;sta atracci&oacute;n en muchas comunidades diversas, usted puede todav&iacute;a preguntarse &ldquo;&iquest;porque Python?&rdquo; o &ldquo;&iquest;porque ense&ntilde;ar programaci&oacute;n con Python?&rdquo; Responder &eacute;stas preguntas no es una tarea f&aacute;cil&mdash; especialmente cuando la opini&oacute;n popular est&aacute; del lado masoquista de usar alternativas como C++ y Java. Sin embargo, pienso que la respuesta mas directa es que la programaci&oacute;n en Python es simplemente mas divertida y mas productiva.\r\n\r\n(...)\r\n\r\nEste libro debe su existencia a la colaboraci&oacute;n hecha posible por Internet y el movimiento de software libre. Sus tres autores&mdash;un profesor de colegio, un profesor de secundaria y un programador profesional&mdash;tienen todav&iacute;a que verse cara a cara, pero han podido trabajar juntos y han sido ayudados por maravillosas personas, quienes han donado su tiempo y energ&iacute;a para ayudar a hacer ver mejor este libro. Nosotros pensamos que este libro es un testamento a los beneficios y futuras posibilidades de esta clase de colaboraci&oacute;n, el marco que se ha puesto en marcha por Richard Stallman y el movimiento de software libre.\r\n\r\nEste trabajo constituye una traducci&oacute;n y Adaptaci&oacute;n del libro: &quot;How to think like a computer scientist, learning with Python&rdquo;, por Allen Downey, disponible tambi&eacute;n en OpenLibra: &lt;a href=&quot;https://openlibra.com/es/book/think-python-how-to-think-like-a-computer-scientist&quot; title=&quot;Think Python, How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Think Python, How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&lt;/a&gt;.",
